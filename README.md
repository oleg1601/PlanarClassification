# Binary classification with a classical neural network
## This notebook presents the development of a classical neural network with hidden layer building upon logistic regression. The neural network learns to distinguish between red and blue points arranged in a floral pattern on a plane.

What to use this notebook for:
- Implement back-propagation algorithm to compute gradients "by hand" for a neural network with a hidden layer.
- Train a binary classifier with a gradient descent scheme.
- Compare and contrast the abilities of a neural network and logistic regression.
